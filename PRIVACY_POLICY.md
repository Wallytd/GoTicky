# GoTicky Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** 2026-01-15

GoTicky (“we”, “our”, “us”) lets people discover events, receive alerts, and buy or manage tickets. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices you have.

## 1) Who controls your data
- Controller: GoTicky
- Contact: privacy@goticky.app and legal@goticky.app
- Regions: We honor local rights where you live (e.g., GDPR/EEA, UK, CCPA/CPRA, POPIA).

## 2) Data we collect
- **Account & identity:** name, email, phone, password (hashed), profile photo.
- **Preferences & activity:** genres, cities, alerts you create, events you view/follow/save, search history, app interactions.
- **Transaction metadata:** ticket selections, order IDs, timestamps, pricing, status. Card data is handled by PCI-compliant processors; we do not store full card numbers.
- **Device & network:** device identifiers, OS/app version, IP, language, time zone, diagnostics, crash logs, and fraud signals.
- **Location (optional):** city/region or device location when you enable location for nearby events or venue guidance. You can disable this in system settings.
- **Support communications:** messages you send to support or feedback forms.

## 3) How we use data
- Provide and improve the Service (ticketing, alerts, recommendations, maps/venue info).
- Process payments and issue tickets via payment providers and venue/organizer systems.
- Prevent fraud and abuse, secure accounts, and detect suspicious activity.
- Send transactional messages (receipts, entry instructions, changes/cancellations). Marketing is opt-in and can be turned off.
- Analyze feature performance, reliability, and safety.

## 4) Sharing and disclosure
We share only what is needed:
- **Payment processors** for checkout; they receive necessary billing and payment info.
- **Organizers/venues** for entry lists, ticket validation, and event operations.
- **Service providers** (cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, email/push delivery, customer support, maps). Examples include Firebase/Google services and PCI-compliant payment providers.
- **Legal or safety**: to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect users and the Service.
- We do **not** sell your personal data.

## 5) Your choices and rights
- Access, correct, or delete your data; download/export where supported.
- Opt out of marketing communications; control alert preferences in-app.
- Control location access in device settings; if disabled, location features may be limited.
- Withdraw consent where we rely on consent (e.g., marketing, location).
- To exercise rights, contact privacy@goticky.app. We will verify requests consistent with applicable law.

## 6) Retention
We keep data while your account is active or as needed for the purposes above. We retain limited records to meet legal, accounting, fraud-prevention, and security obligations. When no longer needed, we delete or de-identify data.

## 7) Security
We use TLS in transit, restricted access, encryption for sensitive tokens, and monitoring for fraud/abuse. No system is 100% secure; please use strong, unique passwords and protect your devices.

## 8) International transfers
Data may be stored or processed in countries other than yours. We use safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses where applicable) to protect data during transfers.

## 9) Children
GoTicky is not directed to children under 16. If we learn a child provided data without consent, we will delete it.

## 10) Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be highlighted in-app or on our site. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
