# GoTicky Terms of Service
**Effective date:** 2026-01-15

GoTicky lets people discover events, receive alerts, and buy or manage tickets. By using GoTicky (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1) Who we are
GoTicky (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates the Service and related sites/apps. Contact: legal@goticky.app or privacy@goticky.app.

## 2) Eligibility & accounts
- You must be at least 16 and legally able to contract in your region.
- Keep your account info accurate. You are responsible for activity under your credentials.
- We may suspend or disable accounts for fraud, abuse, or policy violations.

## 3) Ticketing, pricing, and fees
- Ticket availability, pricing, seating, and event rules are set by organizers/venues; we surface their policies.
- Payments are processed by PCI-compliant providers; we do not store full card details.
- Refunds, transfers, or exchanges follow the organizer’s policy. Where supported, we surface available options; otherwise sales are typically final.
- Chargebacks and unpaid balances may result in account limits or recovery actions.

## 4) Recommendations, alerts, and communications
- You may receive recommendations, alerts, or updates about events you view, follow, or purchase. You can adjust preferences in settings or via provided controls.
- Transactional messages (receipts, entry instructions, security notices) are necessary for the Service.

## 5) User content and acceptable use
- You may not misuse the Service (e.g., fraud, scalping/bots, harassment, scraping, reverse engineering, interference with security, or violating venue/organizer rules).
- If you submit content (e.g., profile details or reviews), you give us a non-exclusive license to display and use it for operating the Service. You must own or have rights to anything you submit.

## 6) Intellectual property
All GoTicky branding, designs, code, and content are owned by us or our licensors. Your use is limited to accessing the Service under these Terms. Do not copy, resell, or create derivative works without permission.

## 7) Third-party services
The Service may link to or rely on third-party services (payment processors, map/providers, analytics). Their terms and privacy policies govern your use of those services.

## 8) Disclaimers
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Event details, availability, and schedules are provided by organizers and may change.

## 9) Limitation of liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for event changes/cancellations outside our control. Our aggregate liability for claims related to the Service will not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid through the Service in the 12 months before the claim or (b) USD $100.

## 10) Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold GoTicky harmless from claims arising out of your misuse of the Service, violation of these Terms, or infringement of third-party rights.

## 11) Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations, fraud risk, or legal/compliance reasons. Certain sections (e.g., IP ownership, limitations, indemnity) survive termination.

## 12) Changes to the Service or Terms
We may update the Service or these Terms. Material changes will be highlighted in-app or on our site. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 13) Governing law and disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of Zimbabwe (without regard to conflict-of-law rules), except where local law requires otherwise. Venue for disputes will be courts with jurisdiction over our principal place of business, unless applicable law provides consumer venue rights.
